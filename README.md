Veloride Ridesharing App – Maps, Chat, Analytics, Authentication & AI

This project aims to promote affordable ride sharing for everyone, regardless of financial background. It has the potential to make a significant impact, as there aren't many carpooling apps that combine affordability with AI-powered features. So far, I’ve implemented a complete chat system, analytics, authentication, maps, third-party APIs and more features will be added as the project grows.
